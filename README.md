## JavaScript Interview Preparation

I know it is quite hectic to prepare for interviews. Specially, JavaScript ones where the grilling is increasing. Hence, my motivation for creating this repository was to have a single place to cover all of my interview preparation needs. This repository' focus will be towards JavaScript but I am maintaining another repository for [React.js](https://github.com/mohitkumartoshniwal/reactjs-interview-preparation/tree/main)
